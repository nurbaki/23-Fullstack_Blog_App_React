# 23-Fullstack_Blog_App_React

I developed this blog application as the Capstone Project of the Full Stack Developer training. I made both the Frontend and Backend side of this project myself.

In this project, I developed a database using SQLite with the help of Python Django. I generated API addresses from this database with the REST API framework. I created blog pages by pulling data in REACT components from these API addresses that I will use on the Frontend side.

In addition to these, in the development of the project I also benefited from;
- Bootstrap,
- React Toastify,
- Swagger

Some of the functions and React hooks I used while developing the project are as follows;
- Fetch Methods,
- useState, useEffect, useContext.
